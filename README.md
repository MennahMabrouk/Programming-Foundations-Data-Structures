Summary of LinkedIn Course 

Array:
If we did not use an array or another data structure, it would be very hard to keep track of how many numbers and which numbers to use in our computation. 
Without the array, there would be no organization to our data. This is why data structures are so important. 
They store and organize pieces of our data so that we can access them later.

Jagged arrays:
With a jagged array, the number of columns is not fixed, meaning the inner arrays can be any length we'd like. This means that if we're iterating through the array, we'll need to access the length of each individual array because their sizes can be different. 

For C# file:
Jagged arrays can be optimized at the intermediate language level and this can be exploited to speed up programs. Now, C# natively differentiates between a jagged and multi-dimensional array, but many other languages don't.
