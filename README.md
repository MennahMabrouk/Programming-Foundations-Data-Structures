# Programming-Foundations-Data-Structures
Summary of LinkedIn Course 

If we did not use an array or another data structure, it would be very hard to keep track of how many numbers and which numbers to use in our computation. 
Without the array, there would be no organization to our data. This is why data structures are so important. 
They store and organize pieces of our data so that we can access them later.
